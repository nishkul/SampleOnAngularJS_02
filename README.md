Allow to see data in list form and here you can edit,save  and update it

To run this simple angularjs application you required http-server , json-server and angularjs javascript file 
Here
1>"HTTP server" is another term for Web server. A Web server is a software program that maps URL requests from a Web client 
(typically a browser) to a resource that will handle the request and return a response to the client.
Url can be 127.0.0.1 or your localhost 
http-server is a simple, zero-configuration command-line http server. It is powerful enough for production usage, 
but it's simple and hackable enough to be used for testing, local development, and learning.


2>For "json-server" give  a full fake REST API with zero coding in less than 30 seconds 
Created with <3 for front-end developers who need a quick back-end for prototyping and mocking.

3>And  AngularJS is a JavaScript framework. It is a library written in JavaScript.
AngularJS is distributed as a JavaScript file, and can be added to a web page with a script tag:
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.8/angular.min.js"></script>


To run above both server http-server and json-server, required to install npm(node package manager) in system 

Installation via npm:

 for http server-> npm install http-server -g (here g refer to globally so that it may be run from the command line.)
 
 
 for json server-> npm install -g json-server
 to start 
 
 json-server db.json (fake json file default it run in 3000 port no you can change it by specify it -p <you port no >  )
